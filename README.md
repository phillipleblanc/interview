Coding Interview problems

## Data Ingestor

Write an API that can accept different payloads of data with multiple formats (i.e. csv, yaml, json)

Start with an API that can accept a single type of data and stores it inefficiently in that format. It can also return data in that type.

Extend the API to accept two other types of data, and also to output in any of the supported ingestion formats.

Write unit tests.
